# Implementation Plan for `/study_sessions/:id/review` POST Route

## Objective

Implement the `/api/study-sessions/:id/review` POST route to record word review results for a specific study session.

## Steps

### 1. Understand the Requirements ✓

- [x] Review the existing codebase to understand how word reviews are structured
- [x] Identify the data structure needed (e.g., required fields for word reviews)
- [x] Understand how the `word_review_items` table is used

### 2. Define the Route ✓

- [x] Add a new route for `/api/study-sessions/:id/review` with POST method
- [x] Set up route parameters to capture the study session ID
- [x] Add cross-origin decorator for CORS support

### 3. Handle Request Data ✓

- [x] Use `request.get_json()` to retrieve the JSON data
- [x] Define expected request body format (e.g., `word_id`, `correct` flag)
- [x] Validate the incoming data:
  - [x] Check if study session exists
  - [x] Validate required fields
  - [x] Validate data types

### 4. Insert Review Data ✓

- [x] Write SQL INSERT statement for `word_review_items` table
- [x] Include:
  - [x] study_session_id (from URL)
  - [x] word_id (from request)
  - [x] correct flag (from request)
  - [x] created_at timestamp
- [x] Use cursor to execute SQL
- [x] Handle potential database errors

### 5. Return Response ✓

- [x] Return success response with appropriate status code (201)
- [x] Include relevant data in response (e.g., review item ID)
- [x] Handle and return appropriate error responses:
  - [x] 404 for session not found
  - [x] 400 for invalid data
  - [x] 500 for server errors

### 6. Write Tests ✓

- [x] Write unit tests:
  - [x] Test successful review submission
  - [x] Test invalid session ID
  - [x] Test missing required fields
  - [x] Test invalid data types
- [x] Run tests and verify they pass

### 7. Documentation ✓

- [x] Add docstring to the new route function
- [x] Document:
  - [x] Expected request format
  - [x] Response format
  - [x] Possible error cases
  - [x] Example usage

### 8. Code Review Preparation ✓

- [x] Review code for:
  - [x] Proper error handling
    - Handles missing/invalid JSON data
    - Handles database errors with rollback
    - Handles invalid session IDs
    - Returns appropriate status codes (400, 404, 500)
  - [x] Code style consistency
    - Follows existing route patterns
    - Consistent indentation and spacing
    - Clear variable names
  - [x] Clear comments
    - Comprehensive docstring
    - Well-documented code sections
    - Clear error messages
  - [x] Test coverage
    - Tests all success cases
    - Tests all error cases
    - Tests data validation
- [x] Prepare pull request

## Implementation Complete ✓

All steps have been completed and verified:

1. Requirements understood
2. Route defined
3. Request data handling
4. Database operations
5. Response handling
6. Test coverage
7. Documentation
8. Code review
