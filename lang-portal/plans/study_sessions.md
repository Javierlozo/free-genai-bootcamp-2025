# Implementation Plan for `/study_sessions` POST Route

## Objective

Implement the `/study_sessions` POST route to create a new study session.

## Steps

### 1. Understand the Requirements

- [x] Review the existing codebase to understand how other routes are structured.
- [x] Identify the data structure for a study session (e.g., required fields).

### 2. Define the Route

- [x] Add a new route for `/api/study-sessions` with the POST method in `routes/study_sessions.py`.

### 3. Handle Request Data

- [x] Use `request.get_json()` to retrieve the JSON data sent in the POST request.
- [x] Validate the incoming data (e.g., check for required fields like `group_id`, `activity_id`, etc.).

### 4. Insert Data into the Database

- [x] Write an SQL INSERT statement to add the new study session to the `study_sessions` table.
- [x] Use a cursor to execute the SQL statement and handle any potential exceptions.

### 5. Return a Response

- [x] Return a JSON response indicating success, including the ID of the newly created study session.
- [x] Handle errors appropriately and return a relevant error message.

### 6. Update the Code

- [x] Add comments to the new code for clarity.
- [x] Ensure the new route follows the coding style and conventions used in the existing codebase.

### 7. Testing

- [x] Write unit tests for the new POST route.
  - [x] Test successful creation of a study session.
  - [x] Test validation errors (e.g., missing required fields).
  - [x] Test error handling (e.g., database errors).
- [x] Run the tests to ensure they pass.

### 8. Documentation

- [x] Update any relevant API documentation to include the new POST route.
- [x] Document the expected request body and response format.

### 9. Code Review

- [ ] Submit the code for review by a senior developer.
- [ ] Address any feedback received during the review process.

### 10. Deployment

- [ ] Merge the changes into the main branch after approval.
- [ ] Deploy the updated code to the staging environment for further testing.

## Notes

- Ensure to follow best practices for error handling and data validation.
- Keep the code modular and maintainable.
